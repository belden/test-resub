NAME
    Test::Resub - Lexically scoped subroutine replacement, primarily 
                  for unit testing

SYNOPSIS
         use Test::More tests => 4;
         use Test::Resub qw(resub);

         {
           package Somewhere;
           sub show {
             my ($class, $message) = @_;
             return "$class, $message";
           }
         }

         # sanity
         is( Somewhere->show('beyond the sea'), 'Somewhere, beyond the sea' );

         # scoped replacement of subroutine with argument capturing
         {
           my $rs = resub 'Somewhere::show', sub { 'hi' }, capture => 1;
           is( Somewhere->show('over the rainbow'), 'hi' );
           is_deeply( $rs->method_args, [['over the rainbow']] );
         }

         # scope ends, resub goes away, original code returns
         is( Somewhere->show('waiting for me'), 'Somewhere, waiting for me' );


DESCRIPTION
       This module allows you to temporarily replace a subroutine/method with
       arbitrary code.  Later, you can tell how many times was it called and
       with what arguments each time.  You can also specify that the subrou-
       tine/method must get called, must not get called, or may be optionally
       called.
